    <p><strong>Evolutionary Exoskeleton for Teenagers with Reduced Mobility</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PI:</strong> Hang SU</li>
        <li><strong>Funding Period:</strong> 2024.1~2027.12</li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> This project targets to develop an advanced evolutionary exoskeleton specifically designed for teenagers with reduced mobility. By utilizing the innovative Servo Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (SEHA) technology, the project aims to provide a highly adaptable and intuitive mobility solution that can adjust to the growth and changing needs of adolescents. The focus is on ensuring that the exoskeleton mimics natural human motion, enhances safety through force compensation, and integrates seamlessly with real-time control systems. This comprehensive approach not only aims to improve the physical mobility of users but also enhances their overall quality of life by incorporating immersive multi-modal interactions and personalized adaptations.</li>
