<div class="about-me">


<p>I am currently a Professor at the IBISC Lab, Université Paris-Saclay, France. My research focuses on robotics, human–robot interaction, exoskeletons, embodied intelligence, and AI. I have published more than 120 papers in international journals and conferences. My work has been recognized with awards including the Outstanding Interaction Paper at ICRA 2022, the Andrew P. Sage Best Transactions Paper Award (IEEE THMS, 2021), the Best Conference Paper in Advanced Robotics at ICARM 2020, and an ICRA Travel Award from the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society in 2019. I have been included in Stanford’s Top 2% Scientists for the past five years (2021–2025).</p>

<p>I also contribute to the community through editorial service, including Associate Editor of the IEEE SMC Society eNewsletter and associate-editor roles with several IEEE Transactions and leading robotics conferences such as ICRA and IROS.</p>
